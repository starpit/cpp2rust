# Virtual Classes

A pointer to a virtual class cannot be a `Ptr<T>`. `Ptr<T>` requires `T: Sized`,
the implicit bound on every generic parameter, and a virtual class is translated
as a Rust trait, whose trait object `dyn T` is unsized and cannot satisfy that
bound. The runtime provides a dedicated `PtrDyn<dyn T>` type, declared with
`T: ?Sized`, for these pointers, kept separate so the generic `Ptr` pays no cost
for dynamic dispatch.

A `PtrDyn` is created at the point where C++ converts a derived pointer to a
base pointer. `Ptr::to_dyn` takes the weak reference out of the `Ptr<Derived>`
and applies Rust's unsized coercion to it, turning a `Weak<RefCell<Derived>>`
into a `Weak<RefCell<dyn Base>>`, without ever upgrading it. The coercion itself
is written by the code generator as the closure `|w| w`, whose return type
selects the target trait object.

The conversion looks like this:

```cpp
struct Base { virtual int f() const = 0; };
struct Derived : Base { int f() const override { return 1; } };

Derived d;
Base *b = &d;
int r = b->f();
```

```rust
let d: Value<Derived> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(<Derived>::default()));
let b: Value<PtrDyn<dyn Base>> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(
    (d.as_pointer()).to_dyn::<dyn Base>(|w| w),
));
let r: Value<i32> = Rc::new(RefCell::new(
    ({ (*(*b.borrow()).upgrade().deref()).f() }),
));
```

A virtual call goes through `upgrade`, which returns a `StrongPtrDyn<dyn T>`
holding the strong reference; its `deref` and `deref_mut` borrow the object and
the call dispatches through the trait's vtable.

`PtrDyn` is far smaller than `Ptr`: it is either null or a weak reference to a
single object, on the stack or on the heap. `Ptr::to_dyn` keeps that
distinction, so a base pointer made from a `new`ed object can be `delete`d and
one made from a local cannot. It has no arithmetic, no comparison, no array
kinds, and no byte view. Because `to_dyn` is only defined for single-value
pointers, a base pointer into an array of polymorphic objects (a
`Derived arr[N]` walked through a `Base *`) cannot be formed.
